## What is it? <a name = "what"></a>
It's just a namespace that I lug around everywhere to make development simple.
## Why does it exist? <a name = "why"></a>
Setting up the same development deps and fns everywhere you go is tiresome.
## How do I use it? <a name = "usage"></a>
You could use it. Or you could just take the fns that you find useful and put them in your own namespace.
## Is it finished? <a name = "todo"></a>
Never.
## How can I help? <a name = "contribute"></a>
Fork it. If you're doing something cool, start a discussion.
## Did you show gratitude? <a name = "contribute"></a>
